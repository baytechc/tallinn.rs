## Build
Make sure you have [npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run `npx @11ty/eleventy` which generates the static pages and puts the output in `./_site`. It uses the sources in [`pages`](./pages/).

You can also use `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` to start a development server.

More info about [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).
